# Finding the rank of a matrix
> The rank of a matrix is the largest number of linearly independent rows/columns of the matrix. The rank is not only defined for square matrices.The rank of a matrix can also be defined as the largest order of any non-zero minor in the matrix.Let the matrix be rectangular and have size NÃ—M. Note that if the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, then the rank is N (=M); otherwise it will be less. Generally, the rank of a matrix does not exceed min(N,M).

```
const double EPS = 1E-9;

int compute_rank(vector<vector<double>> A) {
    int n = A.size();
    int m = A[0].size();

    int rank = 0;
    vector<bool> row_selected(n, false);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int j;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (!row_selected[j] && abs(A[j][i]) > EPS)
                break;
        }

        if (j != n) {
            ++rank;
            row_selected[j] = true;
            for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                A[j][p] /= A[j][i];
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (k != j && abs(A[k][i]) > EPS) {
                    for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                        A[k][p] -= A[j][p] * A[k][i];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return rank;
